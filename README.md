Credits from proposal (used for CSC562 grading):

0. properly turn in : (5%)
    The project is properly turned in on this page.
1. Basic Scene Setup :(10%)
    There is a player and a boss in the scene. The boss has a life bar, and spell indicator on the left, spell card's name on the right.
2. COMPONENT/EFFECT: basic attack (15%)
    press z for basic attack, press x for protection charm. Before entering a spell card (in which the main background will be turn red),       boss has some simple attack. In the spell card, several CG technique will be used (will be mentioned below)
3. COMPONENT/EFFECT: shadow (25%)
    All objects in the scene are having shadow. To be more specific, in stage 2 ([Earth Spell] Natural Mosaic), several balls will fall         down from the sky. Player can see the shadow (although not very obvious because of red background and they are transparent in some         degree) to dodge the attack from the sky.(Although they are designed to be harmless)
4. COMPONENT/EFFECT: explosion (20%)
    Player death would generate some explosion. (It can be easily observed if the player collide with rocks or lasers) Furthermore, in the final stage ([Thunder Spell] Particle Overflow), this shows some kinds of explosion attack.
5. COMPONENT/EFFECT: refraction (25%)
    The refraction effect can be observed in two spell cards([Earth Spell] Natural Mosaic, and [Earth Spell] The Great Refraction Wall) in stage 2 and 4. In these two stage, a mosaic like ball or wall is generated. The effect of refraction (some degree of distortion) can be observed by looking at the rock, boss, and the player.
6. COMPONENT/EFFECT: Fluid and Goo (15% EXTRA)
    This effect can be observed in stage 6 ([Earth Spell] Rockshark). Water will splash when the rocks emerged from underwater.
7. COMPONENT/EFFECT: Laser (5% EXTRA)
    The laser effect is shown in several stage, but mostly can see its power in stage 1 (Beginning of the Star Road). The laser will be generate based on player's position. After a few second, the laser is on and player would be hit if he is still on the laser line.
